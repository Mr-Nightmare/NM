Imagine your game is like a busy chef in a kitchen. The chef can't do all the cooking 
and serve customers at the same time. So, the chef decides to hire a helper to handle 
the cooking while they focus on serving.

In your game code:

implements Runnable: This is like saying, "Hey, I'm hiring a helper, 
and here's what they can doâ€”they can run a set of instructions."

startGameThread method: This is like telling the helper, 
"Okay, start working!" It creates the helper (thread) and tells it to start doing its job.

run method: This is the actual job the helper does. 
In your case, it's saying, "Keep doing this task as long as I don't tell you to stop." 
Your chef (main program) can now focus on other things while the helper takes care of running this specific task.
